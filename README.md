# Digital Nomad UK

This is an learning project where i aim to create a small utility to keep track of the time spent outside this rainy island that I have been calling 'Home' for the past 11 years.

I am not yet sure of the direction this will take but I thought it would be a nice place to start building something.

## What does this do? 
The fundamental idea behind this is to track the number of days that have been spent out of the UK in the last year (365 days).

## What does the UX look like?
In the beginning this likely be a binary, manually ran. In time, I'd like to experiment with this to add more features, including:
- building a Web app for it so it can be launched from any phone;
- adding authentication (using Sign in with Google)
- Storing holidays in a database
